# The Odin Project Recipe Website

Howdy! This is my project to practice basic HTML and later use this to practice CSS.

The goals for this projects are:
- Configure correct file paths for a basic website
- Set up boilerplates for HTML files
- Use links within the website and to outside webs with good practice in mind
- Insert images and remember to add alt texts
